## Unified DeFi Model

Decentrifi takes a pioneering approach in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by introducing a unified model that encompasses all DeFi primitives. Our mission is to streamline and consolidate the vast array of DeFi functionalities into a cohesive framework, simplifying the development and integration process for developers and integrators.

In the fragmented world of DeFi, where various protocols and primitives operate independently, Decentrifi stands as a beacon of unity. We envision a future where developers can seamlessly harness the power of multiple DeFi primitives without the complexities of navigating disparate systems.

Our unified model provides a comprehensive and standardized framework that spans the entire spectrum of DeFi functionalities. Whether you're exploring lending and borrowing, decentralized exchanges, asset management, or any other DeFi primitive, Decentrifi offers a cohesive architecture that promotes interoperability and ease of integration.

By adopting our unified model, developers and integrators can accelerate their development cycles and reduce complexities associated with integrating multiple protocols. The modular nature of our model enables easy customization, allowing for the creation of tailored DeFi solutions that meet specific project requirements.

With Decentrifi, developers and integrators can focus on building innovative applications and services, leveraging a unified infrastructure that abstracts the underlying complexities of individual DeFi primitives. This streamlined approach empowers developers to unlock the true potential of DeFi without being burdened by the intricacies of protocol-specific implementations.

As we continue to expand our ecosystem, we actively seek to collaborate with DeFi projects and protocols, inviting them to integrate into our unified model. Through these partnerships, we foster a more seamless and harmonious DeFi landscape, driving standardization and interoperability across the industry.

## Building the project

The project is entirely written in Kotlin. The only prerequisite is to have a JDK 17+ installed.

```shell
./mvn clean package
```

## Submodules
